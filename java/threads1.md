### challenges 
**scenario1:** You are designing a multi-threaded application that needs to download and process multiple files simultaneously. Write a program to download three files at the same time, and then merge the contents of these files into a single file.

**scenario2:** 
You have a list of 1000 tasks that need to be executed. The tasks are independent and can be executed in parallel. Write a program to execute all these tasks using the Executor Framework.

**scenario3:** 
You have a queue of 1000 tasks that need to be executed in order. Each task takes a random amount of time to execute. Write a program to execute all these tasks using the Executor Framework while maintaining the order.

**scenario4:** 
You have a list of tasks, and each task can be executed in parallel. However, you need to limit the number of threads used to execute these tasks to a fixed number, say 5. Write a program to execute these tasks using the Executor Framework, ensuring that no more than 5 tasks are executed in parallel.

**scenario5:** 
You have a collection of 1000 URLs that need to be downloaded in parallel. However, you need to limit the number of concurrent downloads to 10. Write a program to download all these URLs using the Executor Framework, ensuring that no more than 10 downloads are done in parallel.
